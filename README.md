## Description
I completed this project over the course of 72 hours using godot 4.2.1, free assets, [BeepBox](https://www.beepbox.co/), paint, and lots of hard work.

Protect your dragon hoard from the endless onslaught of dragons! The more treasure, you have, the more danger you attract!

## Controls
Use the arrow keys or WASD to move and be sure to pick up power ups that drop from defeated enemies!
